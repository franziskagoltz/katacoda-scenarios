That’s all!
With just three simple commands we were able to install Linkerd on our
Kubernetes cluster, install an app, and use Linkerd to gain visibility into
the health of the app’s services. Of course, Linkerd is providing much more
than visibility: under the hood, we’ve enabled latency-aware load balancing,
automatic retries and circuit breaking, distributed tracing, and more.

For help with this or anything else about Linkerd, feel free to stop by our
[Linkerd community Slack](http://slack.linkerd.io/), or post a topic on
[Linkerd discourse](https://discourse.linkerd.io/top/all)!
